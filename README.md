## What's BMI ?
BMI stands for Body Mass Index, and it is a simple calculation used to estimate an individual's body fat based on their height and weight. It is widely used as a basic indicator of healthy body weight, although it has some limitations and should not be used as the sole measure of an individual's health status.

The BMI formula is calculated as follows:

BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2

Once the BMI is calculated, it is placed into one of the following categories:

- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
- Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
- Obesity: BMI of 30 or greater
